# Source code for my from-scratch TypeScript and React based website!
For the purpose of wanting to better understand how the building blocks of a typical modern React frontend fit together, I decided to not use a starter such as create-react-app or a framework like NextJS.
Instead, I configured my own webpack, babel, eslint, prettier and tsconfig for this project.

## Libraries / Frameworks used in v1
* React
* React-router
* Styled Components
* TypeScript
* Webpack
* ESLint & Prettier
* Babel

## Todo
* For v2 of the website, I wish to take a more content-first approach, and convert this project to use NextJS and statically generate webpages from markdown file sources.
* Write Jest tests for components.
